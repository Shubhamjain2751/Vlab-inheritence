			<p>When a java class extends a java class all the predefined methods of parent class are inherited automatically.</p>
			<div>For example:<br> A car comes with a variety of features like steering-wheel, brakes, engine and many more. But what to consider in his's/her's work is totally dependent on the user. In case of ordinary people he/she will mainly access the steering - wheel, brakes while in case of mechanic he/she may access an engine.<br>So here Car is the parent class with various features and driver and mechanic extend class Car to use its feature. All methods are accessible to both, but what to use is dependent each of an individual's choices.</div>

		<div class="block" style="margin-bottom:30px">
			<p>When a java class implements a java class programmer can inherit required methods from parent class instead of all methods.</p>
			<div>For example:<br>There are four basic mathematical operations like Addition, Subtraction ,Multiplication and Division.<br>
			Mutiplication of two numbers can be obtained by using direct muiplication operator or by adding first number the times of second number.So a task can have different ways of implementation.<br>So here one can implement Mathematical operation class and inherit the required method (here multipliction) and define it in his/her way.</div>
